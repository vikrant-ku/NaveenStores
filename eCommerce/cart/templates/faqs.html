                                <h4 id="faq-1"><strong>Q.</strong>What amount of time does the shipment order take to be delivered?</h4>
                                <p>We make an honest effort to deliver your orders at the earliest opportunity. Processing and dispatching a package is usually done within 24 - 48 hours. Although, it also depends on your PIN code. However, we do specify a standard delivery date in the order confirmation mail.</p>
                               

                                <h4 id="faq-2"><strong>Q.</strong> How can I track my order?</h4>
                                <p>You can easily track your orders through the Online Tracking Facility under “My Orders”.</p>
                               
                                <h4 id="faq-3"><strong>Q.</strong> What happens when a purchased product goes out of stock?</h4>
                                <p>We try to keep stock of all products as listed on our website. In case a purchased product goes out of stock, we will inform the same to you within 2 working days of your purchase. Then you can either purchase some other product or your money will be duly refunded.</p>
                              

                                <h4 id="faq-4"><strong>Q.</strong> Can I place an order for different products for different shipment addresses in a single order?</h4>
                                <p>No, we only process one shipping address per order. So, if you want to order multiple products and want them shipped to different addresses, they will be treated as separate orders.</p>
                               

                                <h4 id="faq-5"><strong>Q.</strong>  What happens if no one is there to receive the package/shipment, at the address provided?</h4>
                                <p>Our courier partners will make 3 delivery attempts at the address as specified by you. If no delivery is made in all these 3 attempts, the package will be considered non-delivered and then shipped back to us.</p>
                               
                                <h4 id="faq-6"><strong>Q.</strong>Do you deliver Internationally? What are the shipping charges for International Delivery?</h4>
                                <p>Yes, we do have an option for International Delivery, and shipping charges for the same usually depend on the total bill and the shipping address. The final amount to be charged will be calculated at the final bill generation.</p>
                               
                                <h4 id="faq-7"><strong>Q.</strong> What is the estimated delivery time?</h4>
                                <p>Our shipment usually takes 7-10 working days to be delivered. For international orders, the shipment can take 10-15 working days.<br>
                                *The delivery time may vary as per the product and the PIN code</p>
                               

                                <h4 id="faq-8"><strong>Q.</strong>What modes of payments are available at Naveen Stores?</h4>
                                <p>We offer multiple payment options, like Credit Card, Debit Card, Google Pay, UPI,  Paytm, and Net Banking Facility.</p>
                               
                                <h4 id="faq-9"><strong>Q.</strong>Is Cash on Delivery available?</h4>
                                <p>No</p>
                               

                                <h4 id="faq-10"><strong>Q.</strong> If I receive a faulty product, would that be replaced?</h4>
                                <p>We only sell good quality products, but if in case you get a damaged product, we do have replacement options available.</p>
                               

                                <h4 id="faq-11"><strong>Q.</strong>What about your refund policy?</h4>
                                <p class="mb-0">We do have a refund option available, but <strong>if and only if the product is faulty or damaged.</strong></p>
                              

                                <h4 id="faq-12"><strong class="my-4">Q.</strong> What about order cancellation?</h4>
                                <p>We do have a provision of cancellation but it is only acceptable <strong>if the order gets canceled within 24 hours of order placement.</strong> Once the order gets shipped, it can not be canceled.</p>
